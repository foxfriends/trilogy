# Trilogy

[![Spec](https://github.com/foxfriends/trilogy/actions/workflows/spec.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/foxfriends/trilogy/actions/workflows/spec.yaml)

My third attempt at building a programming language[^1][^2].

Also a programming language that more closely resembles three languages
at once than any one single language. You'll see what I mean when it
comes out.

Thus, this makes a trilogy. Hopefully I produce something useful this time.

Third time's the charm!

[^1]: First few were school projects, WLP4 (a subset of C), and Joos (a subset of Java), and maybe a few others. Though technically I did (attempt to) implement them (with friends), they aren't *my* languages, and I cannot produce such source code.
[^2]: Third was [Lumber](https://github.com/foxfriends/lumber), an experiment at a functioning language.

## Status

As you can see, progress at this time is limited:

- [x] Read some papers and instructions on programming languages
    - https://www.eff-lang.org/handlers-tutorial.pdf
    - http://www.math.bas.bg/bantchev/place/iswim/j-explanation.pdf
    - https://cs.ru.nl/~dfrumin/notes/delim.html
    - https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/students/filinski.pdf
    - https://caml.inria.fr/pub/papers/xleroy-applicative_functors-popl95.pdf
- [ ] Design the language (In Progress)
- [ ] Read the [book](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) (In Progress)
- [ ] Specify the language
- [ ] Start the project
