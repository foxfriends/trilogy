# Trilogy

[![Spec](https://github.com/foxfriends/trilogy/actions/workflows/spec.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/foxfriends/trilogy/actions/workflows/spec.yaml)
[![Rust CI](https://github.com/foxfriends/trilogy/actions/workflows/rust.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/foxfriends/trilogy/actions/workflows/rust.yml)

My (approximately) third attempt at building a programming language[^1][^2].

Also a programming language that more closely resembles three languages
at once than any one single language.

That makes a trilogy. Hopefully I produce something useful. Third time's the charm!

[^1]: First few were school projects, WLP4 (a subset of C), and Joos (a subset of Java), and maybe a few others. Though technically I did (attempt to) implement them (with friends), they aren't *my* languages, so I cannot provide the source code.
[^2]: The first I could call my own was [Lumber](https://github.com/foxfriends/lumber), an experiment at a functioning language.

## Status

As you can see, progress at this time is limited:

- [x] Read some papers and instructions on programming languages
