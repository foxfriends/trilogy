# Trilogy Intermedate Representation

A very vague name, maybe we'll have more than one intermediate representation in future,
but this one in particular is basically a streamlined version of the AST, which is more
graphlike and less directly reflective of the original source structure of the program,
intended to lexical analysis simpler.
