\section{Type System}

\Trilogy{} is (currently) a dynamically typed language; all types are determined
and checked at runtime. Recall that ``dynamically typed'' is not the absence of
a type system, but the presence of a type system so complex that it cannot be
fully statically analyzed.

Despite the lack of static analysis, we attempt to fully specify the type system
of \Trilogy{} in hopes that someday it can be statically analyzed (an attempt at
(potentially optional) static (higher-kinded? dependent?) typing is on the long
term roadmap).

Worth mentioning is that the type system of \Trilogy{} spans all sub-languages
consistently. The syntax and behaviour of all data types are the same, no matter
where they are being used. The types are summarized below, with exact specifications
of the operators come later, in Syntax and Semantics (\S\ref{sec:syntax})

\subsection{Built-In Types}

There are 5 primitive data types in \Trilogy{}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Never
    \item Unit
    \item Boolean
    \item Atom
    \item Character
    \item String
    \item Number
\end{itemize}

\noindent
There are also 5 compound types, which may be constructed out of primitives
and other types:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Labelled
    \item Tuple
    \item Array
    \item Set
    \item Record
    \item Iterator
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Defined items (and their locally defined counterparts) are also values which
have types:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Procedure
    \item Procedure Closure
    \item Function
    \item Function Closure
    \item Rule
    \item Ruleset
    \item Continuation
    \item Module
    \item Module Function
\end{itemize}

\noindent
There are no explicit user defined types, only combinations of the built in
types, so this is a complete list of all types to be seen in a \Trilogy{}
program.

By no means, however, is this the end of the story for \Trilogy{}'s type
system. Custom data types, as well as further built-in primitive types are,
are on the list of things to implement once the language is in a functioning
state.
