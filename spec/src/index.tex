        \noindent
        Likely an unnecessarily formal specification for this particular language,
        \Trilogy{} is (at this stage) a toy and side project in which I experiment
        with a truly multi-paradigm programming language, while also attempting
        to build a reasonably efficient interpreter and, possibly, someday a
        compiler.

        \Trilogy{} can be interpreted as the union of at least three distinct
        languages in a single box set. I say ``at least'' because, depending on
        your interpretation of ``language'', you might find more than three.
