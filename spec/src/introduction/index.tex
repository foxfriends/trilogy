\section{Introduction}

\noindent As previously alluded to, \Trilogy{} may be affectionally  described
as three languages in a trenchcoat. These languages, each very distinct in
their syntax and semantics, work together to make up \Trilogy{}:

\begin{description}[labelindent=1.5em]
    \item[Prose] a straight forward imperative language;
    \item[Poetry] a more elegant, purely functional language; and
    \item[Law] a fact-and-rule based logical language.
\end{description}

\noindent
Of course, seeing as this trilogy is yet to be written, those languages do not
exist at this time. The following chapters will explore these languages to
gradually build up a formal definition of each and how they weave together
into a cohesive whole.
