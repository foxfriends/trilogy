\section{Overview}

Easier than jumping right into specification, first a human-friendly
description of \Trilogy{}. This language features every feature I can
find, in hopes of covering all the bases for my future scripting or
research needs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Imperative programming with first class procedures
    \item Functional programming with first class functions
    \item Currying and partial application
    \item Logical programming with first class rules
    \item Boolean and predicate logic
    \item Regular pattern matching
    \item Function head pattern matching
    \item Multi-binding pattern matching
    \item Perfect (rational and complex) numbers
    \item UTF-8 strings and characters
    \item Tuples (pairs and empty)
    \item Atoms and structures
    \item Collections (arrays, lists, sets, and records) and iterators
    \item Loops of all sorts
    \item Array, set, record and iterator comprehensions
    \item Effect handlers; and by extension delimited continuations or monads
    \item Syntax sugar!
\end{itemize}

\noindent
All that and this list is probably still incomplete. I'm sure there are things
I am forgetting or overlooking or will add to the language later and forget to
add to this list.
