\subsection{Law}

The semantics of \Law{} are the most fundamental to the whole of \Trilogy{}, and
\Law{} is also syntactically the least complex. \Law{} is also the most isolated
of the three sublanguages, and so easiest to describe without much knowledge beyond
the intuitive understanding of the other two.

For those familiar with logical languages such as Prolog, \Law{} may be
familiar, though with different syntax and less logical impurity. \Law{} can
afford to give up the ability to express certain actions (such as side effects
or computations) given the existence of \Prose{} and \Poetry{}.

Rule~\ref{bnf:patternlist} is marked for reference later, as it will come up
repeatedly.

\begin{bnf}
    \bnfprod*{RuleHead}{
        \bnfpn{Identifier}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfts{(}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{PatternList}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfts{)}
    } \\
    \bnfprod{PatternList}{
        \label{bnf:patternlist}
        \bnfpn{Pattern}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfts{\op{,}}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{PatternList}
        \bnfor
        \bnfpn{Pattern}
        \bnfor
        \bnfes
    } \\
    \bnfprod*{RuleBody}{\bnfpn{Query}}
\end{bnf}

Definitions in \Law{} must have a head, and may optionally include a body. While
definitions in other logic languages such as Prolog may be defined with no parameters,
omitting the parentheses entirely, \Law{} does not permit this. All rules must include
a parameter list. The parameter list may be empty, but the usefulness of such rules
is not certain.

Rules may be defined with the same name and number of parameters, in which case when
applied, all definitions will be used at once, leading to more branching.
