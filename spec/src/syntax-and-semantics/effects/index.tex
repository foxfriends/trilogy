\subsection{Effect System}
\label{sec:effects}

By no means is \Trilogy{} the first language to implement an effect system;
much of what is presented here is based on, and cross checked against, existing
research\cite{eff}.

Sadly, mainstream languages featuring a full fledged first class effect system
are\dots none? At least none I have ever come across. Most languages with an
effect system are experimental or research based, and appear far from practical
to me.

While I can't really claim that \Trilogy{} is much better on being ``practical''
and not ``experimental'', it does aim to take a more user and productivity first
approach to implementing effects than other research languages.

\Trilogy{} includes effects as its core advanced control flow mechanism because
I believe it to be the most concretely conceptualized of the equivalent competing
models, namely monads or delimited control\cite{effmondel}.
