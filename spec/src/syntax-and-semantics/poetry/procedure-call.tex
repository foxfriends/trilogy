\subsubsection{Procedure Call}

Procedures may be called in much the same way as functions are applied. In fact,
single arity procedures and functions can be used interchangeably. The procedure
call syntax only provides the means by which to call functions of arity other than
one.

\begin{bnf*}
    \bnfprod{ProcedureCall}{
        \bnfpn{Expression}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfts{!(}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{ArgumentList}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfts{)}
    } \\
    \bnfprod{ArgumentList}{
        \bnfpn{Expression}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfts{,}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{ArgumentList}
        \bnfor
        \bnfpn{Expression}
        \bnfor
        \bnfes
    }
\end{bnf*}

Semantically, a procedure call looks up an identifier in the current scope to
locate a procedure, and then supplies the provided arguments as the parameters
to the procedure. This is much the same as any function call in any other
imperative language.

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma\vdash p : \texttt{!}(x_{1\hdots n})\rightarrow\tau$}
    \AxiomC{$a_i = x_i$}
    \LeftLabel{Procedure Call}
    \BinaryInfC{$\Gamma\vdash p\texttt{!}(a_{1\hdots n}):\tau$}
\end{prooftree}
