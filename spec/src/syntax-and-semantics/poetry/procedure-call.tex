\subsubsection{Procedure Call}

Procedures may be called in expressions, even in functions. Though this sort of
breaks the ``pureness'' of \Poetry{}, I think it's also sort of justifiable if you
consider the procedure call to actually be syntax sugar for a \kw{yield} that
corresponds to a handler that calls that procedure and resumes with the result.
Assume that handler is applied automatically by the procedure's definition.

\begin{bnf*}
    \bnfprod{ProcedureCall}{
        \bnfpn{Expression}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfts{!(}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{ArgumentList}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfts{)}
    } \\
    \bnfprod{ArgumentList}{
        \bnfpn{Expression}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfts{,}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{ArgumentList}
        \bnfor
        \bnfpn{Expression}
        \bnfor
        \bnfes
    }
\end{bnf*}

Semantically, a procedure call looks up an identifier in the current scope to
locate a procedure, and then supplies the provided arguments as the parameters
to the procedure. This is much the same as any function call in any other
imperative language.

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma\vdash p : \texttt{!}(x_{1\hdots n})\rightarrow\tau$}
    \AxiomC{$a_i = x_i$}
    \LeftLabel{Procedure Call}
    \BinaryInfC{$\Gamma\vdash p\texttt{!}(a_{1\hdots n}):\tau$}
\end{prooftree}
