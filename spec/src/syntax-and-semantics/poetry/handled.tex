\subsubsection{Handled Expressions}

Much like handled blocks in \Prose{}, a handled expression is how \Poetry{}
allows effects to be handled, and uses the \kw{with} keyword as well.

\begin{bnf*}
    \bnfprod{Handled}{
        \bnfts{\kw{with}}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{Expression}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfts{\{}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{EffectHandlers}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfts{\}}
    }
\end{bnf*}

Once again, the semantics of the effect system are left for \S\ref{sec:effects}.
The semantics of the \kw{with} expression itself are very simple:

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma\vdash E : \tau$}
    \LeftLabel{With}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Gamma\vdash \kw{with}\ E : \tau$}
\end{prooftree}
