\subsubsection{Expressions}
\label{sec:expressions}

Seeing as the entirety of \Poetry{} (and admittedly, much of \Trilogy{} as a whole)
is made up of expressions, there are a lot of cases.

Though the expression grammar does include binary operators and other binary keywords
\Trilogy{} does not encode precedence as part of the grammar but instead resolves that
in a later pass in the interpreter (\S\ref{sec:precedence}).
