\subsubsection{Reference}

Defined names may be referenced at any time, their naming evaluating to the value
they currently hold. This is a typical variable reference as in any language.
Notably this is \emph{only} for variable references, looking up a name in another
scope is handled by the member lookup operator (\op{.}) as a binary operation.

Admittedly the following semantics look a little wonky due to an ambiguous choice
of notation. Rest assured, in the hypotheses the $x$ refers to the binding in the
context, while in the inference the $x$ refers to the symbol in source code, so
this is not an infinitely recursive deduction.

    \AxiomC{$\Gamma\vdash x : \tau$}
    \LeftLabel{Reference}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Gamma\vdash x : \tau$}
