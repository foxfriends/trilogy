\subsubsection{Application}

Functions in \Poetry{} are single-argument, and that argument is supplied
simply by writing it after the function, separated by a space. The function
itself may be an expression, including another application expression, allowing
for multi-argument functions to be simulated by passing further space separated
parameters.

\begin{bnf*}
    \bnfprod{Application}{
        \bnfpn{Expr}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{Expr}
    }
\end{bnf*}

The first expression must evaluate to a value of Function type, otherwise
it is a runtime type error.

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma\vdash F : \tau \rightarrow \rho$}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma\vdash E : \tau$}
    \LeftLabel{Application}
    \BinaryInfC{$\Gamma\vdash F\ E : \rho$}
\end{prooftree}

In terms of precedence, the expression \texttt{f~a~b~c} is equivalent to
\texttt{((f~a)~b)~c}. Parentheses and the application operator (\op{|>},
explored in \S\ref{sec:binop}) may be used to manipulate the precedence as
necessary.
