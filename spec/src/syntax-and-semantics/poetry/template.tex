\subsubsection{Templates}

Templates are strings into which other expressions are evaluated and then inserted.
That is, templates are \Trilogy{}'s version of string interpolation.

Templates are not just for string interpolation, however, as they may be \emph{tagged},
allowing them to run user-defined code instead of simple string concatenation,
resulting in non-string results. This idea comes right out of Javascript. A tagged
appears like a function application where the function is a dollar-prefixed identifier,
rather than an arbitrary expression.

The extra template tokens from the scanner pay off here, making parsing relatively easy
for templates.

\begin{bnf*}
    \bnfprod{Template}{
        \bnfpn{TemplateStart}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{TemplateMore}
        \bnfor
    } \\
    \bnfmore{
        \bnfpn{DollarString}
        \bnfor
        \bnfpn{TemplateString}
    } \\
    \bnfprod{TemplateMore}{
        \bnfpn{Expression}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{TemplateMiddle}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{TemplateMore}
        \bnfor
    } \\
    \bnfmore{
        \bnfpn{Expression}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{TemplateEnd}
    }
\end{bnf*}

The semantics are quite different depending on whether the template was tagged
or not. In the untagged case, a template evaluates to a string by evaluating each
inner expression and converting it to its string representation, then concatenating
those strings as if with glue.

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma\vdash E = v$}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma\vdash T = \omega$}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma\vdash S = \sigma\ \op{<>}\ \text{str}(v)\ \op{<>}\ \omega$}
    \LeftLabel{Template}
    \TrinaryInfC{$\Gamma\vdash \sigma\ E\ T = S$}
\end{prooftree}

A tagged template, on the other hand, does not stringify anything. Instead, the
string fragments and the evaluated values are both passed as the parameters to
the function denoted by the tag. This tag function should accept two parameters,
the first the array of string fragments, the second the array of the evaluated
values.

\begin{prooftree}
    \def\defaultHypSeparation{\hskip 0.1in}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma\vdash E_i = v_i$}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma\vdash f : \ty{List String} \rightarrow \ty{List}\ \tau \rightarrow \rho$}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Gamma\vdash f\ \texttt{[}\sigma_0\texttt{,}\ \sigma_1\texttt{,}\ \cdots\texttt{,}\ \sigma_n\texttt{]}\ \texttt{[}v_1\texttt{,}\ \cdots\texttt{,}\ v_n\texttt{]} : \rho$}
    \LeftLabel{Tagged Template}
    \BinaryInfC{$\Gamma\vdash \texttt{\$}f\  \sigma_0\ (E_i\ \sigma_i)^*\ : \rho$}
\end{prooftree}
