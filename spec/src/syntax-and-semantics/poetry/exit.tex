\subsubsection{Exit}

Another execution ending keyword is the \kw{exit} keyword, which not only ends
an execution but the also the entire program. Following execution of \kw{exit}, the
program is treated to have been completed and with the evaluation of the expression
being the exit code, as if that value were returned from \kw{main}. See the section
on Exit Codes (\S\ref{sec:exitcode}) for more details.
