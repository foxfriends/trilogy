\subsection{Poetry}

As \Law{} is a language of binding, and \Prose{} a language of control
flow, \Poetry{} is a language of value. As a pure functional programming
language, \Poetry{} is highly expression-based, though given the existence
of the effect system it is possible to trigger side effects, in a way.

\begin{bnf*}
    \bnfprod{FunctionHead}{
        \bnfpn{Identifier}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{ParameterList}
    } \\
    \bnfprod{ParameterList}{
        \bnfpn{Pattern}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{PatternList}
        \bnfor
        \bnfpn{Pattern}
        \bnfor
        \bnfes
    } \\
    \bnfprod{FunctionBody}{\bnfpn{Expression}}
\end{bnf*}

Similar to Haskell, functions in \Poetry{} are defined as equations. Defining
the same name multiple times is allowed, given that its number of arguments
is the same, and the patterns of its parameters are changed, allowing different
cases of a function to be handled by different expressions. When the function is
applied, the first matching definition in source code order is used, and the
others are skipped.

Also similar to Haskell, functions support currying and partial application by
default. In \Trilogy{}, this is defined as a syntax transformation over function
definitions with multiple parameters into unary functions returning a function
that accepts the next parameter.

\begin{align*}
    \texttt{\$f:id \$(\$r:pat)* \$p:pat = \$e:expr} & \Rightarrow \texttt{\$f \$(\$r)* = \kw{fn} \$p = \$e} %
\end{align*}

The parameter list may be empty, defining a nullary (0-argument) function. As
\Poetry{} is lazy, this function will only be evaluated when its result is
needed, so even a nullary function may, for example, yield an effect which will
only be performed when it is required. Note that the lazy evaluation of \Poetry{}
can lead to some code being run in unexpected order, so it is recommended to
think carefully about whether effects in \Poetry{} are required.

Though \Poetry{} is lazy, \Prose{} and \Law{} (except for through Iterators)
are not. When an expression of \Poetry{} appears in \Prose{} or \Law{},
as in an assignment or unification, it is evaluated immediately. This implies
that while \Poetry{} may be used to represent infinite data structures those
data structures must remain in \Poetry{} or else they will be infinitely
evaluated, unless converted to Iterator.

    \AxiomC{$f\ P\ \texttt{=}\ E$}
    \AxiomC{$P = X$}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma,\setof{a\given a\defby P}\vdash E = v$}
    \LeftLabel{Function}
    \TrinaryInfC{$\Gamma\vdash f(X) = v$}
\end{prooftree}
