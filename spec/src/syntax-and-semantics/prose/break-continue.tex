\subsubsection{Break and Continue}
\label{sec:break-continue}

The statements \kw{break} and \kw{continue} may be used in loops to control iteration.
The \kw{break} statement will exit the loop immediately, skipping all further iteration,
whereas the \kw{continue} statement will end the current iteration and move on to the
next, without executing any further code. This applies for both \kw{for} and \kw{while}
loops.

You might note that these keywords do not accept any label, nor does \Trilogy{} even
have labelled statements. That does not prevent us from breaking out of a parent loop
from a child loop, instead \Trilogy{} supports \emph{first class keywords}
(\S\ref{sec:first-class-keyword}) for this purpose.

\begin{bnf*}
    \bnfprod{SBreak}{\bnfts{\kw{break}}} \\
    \bnfprod{SContinue}{\bnfts{\kw{continue}}}
\end{bnf*}

A \kw{break} or \kw{continue} statement on its own does not evaluate to anything, so
their semantics are uninteresting.

Though the statement ends the local execution, it changes the behaviour of the loop
or block it corresponds to, which picks up the execution before it fizzles completely.

The behaviour of binding the keyword to a loop is only of syntactic concern, so in the
semantics we assume that the break or continue in question has already been resolved to
the correct containing loop.

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash \kw{for}\ Q\ \block{M} : \top$}
    \LeftLabel{Break\textsuperscript{for}}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Gamma \vdash \kw{for}\ Q\ \block{M\ \op{;}\ \kw{break}} : \top$}
\end{prooftree}

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash \kw{while}\ E\ \block{M} : \top$}
    \LeftLabel{Break\textsuperscript{while}}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Gamma \vdash \kw{while}\ E\ \block{M\ \op{;}\ \kw{break}} : \top$}
\end{prooftree}

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash \block{M} : \top$}
    \LeftLabel{Continue}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Gamma \vdash \block{M\ \op{;}\ \kw{continue}} : \top$}
\end{prooftree}
