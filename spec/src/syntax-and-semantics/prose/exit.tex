\subsubsection{Exit}
\label{sec:prose-exit}

The last execution ending statement is the \kw{exit} statement, which not only ends
an execution but the also the entire program. Following an \kw{exit} statement, the
program is treated to have been completed and with the evaluation of the expression
being the exit code, as if that value were returned from \kw{main}. See the section
on Exit Codes (\S\ref{sec:exitcode}) for more details.

\begin{bnf*}
    \bnfprod{SExit}{
        \bnfts{\kw{exit}}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{Expression}
    }
\end{bnf*}

Once again, there is almost nothing to the semantics of the \kw{exit} statement.

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma\vdash N:\top$}
    \LeftLabel{Exit}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Gamma\vdash\kw{end}\ N : \bot$}
\end{prooftree}
