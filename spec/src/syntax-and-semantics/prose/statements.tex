\subsubsection{Statements}

A statement is a single ``step'' of a procedure in \Prose{}. Statements typically do not
evaluate to any value, but they perform effects on the state of the program and its
environment.

Notably, there aren't all that many types of statements in \Prose{}, as \Prose{}
only implements the imperative portions of \Trilogy{}. Most other common structures
are expressions, and so technically part of \Poetry{}. Expressions however can be
used as statements, so you'll hardly notice this distinction.
