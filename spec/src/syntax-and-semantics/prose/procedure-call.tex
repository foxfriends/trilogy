\subsubsection{Procedure Calls}

As previously mentioned, procedure calls are permitted at the top level of
another procedure, as a statement. In this situation, the return value of
the procedure call is lost, but multiple evaluations may be created. Procedure
calls in statement position are also explicitly permitted to carry effect handlers.

\begin{bnf*}
    \bnfprod{SProcedureCall}{
        \bnfpn{ProcedureCall}
        \bnfor
        \bnfpn{ProcedureCall}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{EffectHandlers}
    }
\end{bnf*}

Semantically, a procedure call looks up an identifier in the current scope to
locate a procedure, and then supplies the provided arguments as the parameters
to the procedure. This is much the same as any function call in any other
imperative language.

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma\vdash p\texttt{!}(x_{1\hdots n}):\top$}
    \AxiomC{$a_i = x_i$}
    \LeftLabel{Procedure Call}
    \BinaryInfC{$\Gamma\vdash p\texttt{!}(a_{1\hdots n}):\top$}
\end{prooftree}
