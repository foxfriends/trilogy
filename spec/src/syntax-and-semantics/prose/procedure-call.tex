\subsubsection{Procedure Calls}

As previously mentioned, procedure calls are permitted at the top level of
another procedure, as a statement. In this situation, the return value of
the procedure call is lost, but multiple evaluations may be created. Procedure
calls in statement position are also explicitly permitted to carry effect handlers.

    \bnfprod{SProcedureCall}{
        \bnfpn{ProcedureCall}
        \bnfor
        \bnfpn{ProcedureCall}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{EffectHandlers}
    }
