\subsubsection{Match}
\label{sec:prose-match}

The \kw{match} statement allows for pattern matching, allowing code to branch
on the structure of a value, rather than a Boolean evaluation of an expression.
As \Trilogy{} is a dynamically typed language, it is hard to ensure completeness
of a \kw{match} statement, so completeness is not enforced; a mismatch is skipped
in much the same way a \kw{false} evaluation of an \kw{if} statement is skipped.

The \kw{match} statement takes an expression and is followed by multiple \kw{case}
statements. Each \kw{case} statement has a pattern, a guard, or both, and then a block
of code to run if that case is selected.

To evaluate a \kw{match} statement, the original expression is evaluated, and compared
against the pattern of each \kw{case}; an omitted pattern is interpreted like an underscore
(\texttt{\_}) pattern, matching with any value.

Before committing to a \kw{case} with a matching pattern the guard, if any, is evaluated.
Identifiers bound in the pattern are in scope for this evaluation. If the guard expression
evaluates to \kw{true} (or there are no guards), the case is selected. If the guard expression
evaluates to \kw{false}, it is skipped. If the guard expression evalutes to a non-Boolean result,
it is a runtime type error. An omitted guard is treated to be always \kw{true}.

The block following the first selected case is then run. If no cases are selected,
they are simply ignored and the program continues.

The omitted clauses of the \kw{case} statement are formalized by syntax transformation:

\begin{align*}
    \texttt{\kw{case} \$p:pat} &\Rightarrow \texttt{\kw{case} \$p \kw{if} \kw{true}} \\ %
    \texttt{\kw{case} \kw{if} \$c:expr} &\Rightarrow \texttt{\kw{case} \_ \kw{if} \$c} \\ %
\end{align*}
