\subsection{Prose}

When viewed on its own, \Prose{} has a fairly ``standard'' C-family syntax.

Arbitrary patterns are permitted in the procedure heads, just as in \Law{}'s
rule definitions. This does imply that some procedure calls will fail silently
via fizzling as procedures may not be defined multiple times with different
patterns, in the way that rules or functions may be. It is recommended to only
use such arbitrary patterns in the most certain of cases, and otherwise use
single identifier patterns whenever possible and handle alternative inputs
accordingly.

The ability to define multiple procedures with the same name but different
patterns may be added in future.

\begin{bnf*}
    \bnfprod{ProcedureHead}{
        \bnfts{IdentiferBang}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfts{(}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{PatternList}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfts{)}
    } \\
    \bnfprod{ProcedureBody}{\bnfpn{Sequence}} \\
\end{bnf*}

\noindent A procedure declaration binds the name in the scope of the current module.
As with all kinds of declarations in \Trilogy{}, procedure declarations may be
referenced out of order.

When called, the body of the procedure is run with the formal parameters bound to
the arguments with which the procedure was called. A procedure may use the \kw{return}
keyword to end its evaluation, with its call evaluating to the returned value.
If control runs off the end of the procedure's body, its call evaluates to \kw{unit}.
A procedure may cause a fizzle or branch, in which case all evaluations are propgated
to the call site, conceptually causing the call to fizzle or branch respectively.
