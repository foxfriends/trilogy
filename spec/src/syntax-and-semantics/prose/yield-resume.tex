\subsubsection{Yield, Resume and Cancel}
\label{sec:prose-resume}

The \kw{yield} statement, however simple in appearance, is one of the most
semantically complex statements in all of \Trilogy{}, as it provides direct
access to the effect system that underpins the entirety of \Trilogy{}'s control
flow structure.

The \kw{resume} statement is the response to a \kw{yield}, providing the value
that the \kw{yield} keyword evaluates to (when used in an expression). The
\kw{resume} statement is available only in an effect handler, and is syntactically
invalid when not within an effect handler.

The \kw{cancel} statement is also used in response to a \kw{yield}, providing
the value that the expression on which the handler is attached evaluates to
(when it is an expression). The \kw{cancel} statement is available only in an
effect handler, and is syntactically invalid when not within an effect handler.

In the case of nested effect handlers, the \kw{resume} and \kw{cancel} keywords refer to the
innermost handler's continuation. This is much like \kw{break} or \kw{continue}
on loops. \kw{resume} and \kw{cancel} are first class keywords (\S\ref{sec:first-class-keyword})
to enable resuming or cancelling a parent effect handler from a child one.

The \kw{resume} keyword can be considered to represent the delimited continuation of
the \kw{yield} statement that is performing the current effect, until the
expresson to which the handler for the current \kw{resume} is attached.

While the \kw{yield} statement requires a value (describing the intended effect), the
\kw{resume} statement may be used without a value, in which case the \kw{yield} that
is performing the effect evaluates to \kw{unit}.

        \bnfts{\kw{cancel}}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{Expression}
    }
\end{bnf*}

While the syntax of \kw{yield}, \kw{resume} and \kw{cancel} are easy to specify at
this time, the semantics will be left for later, when we look at the effect system
as a whole in \S\ref{sec:effects}.
