\subsubsection{End}

The last execution ending statement is the \kw{end} statement, of which the only
purpose is to explicitly end an execution.

The \kw{end} statement may be bare, or be provided a single value. In the case of
a bare \kw{end} statement, the execution is simply stopped, the same as any fizzle.

Meanwhile, provided a value, the execution is treated to have been completed and
the value is its final result. While this value is not currently accessible from
within the program, it is used to treat the current execution as if it had returned
that value from the \fn{main} procedure, which has some effect on the resulting
exit code of the program (\S\ref{sec:exitcode}).

        \bnfts{\kw{end}}
        \bnfor
        \bnfts{\kw{end}}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{Expression}
    }
\end{bnf*}

Semantically, the \kw{end} statement is very simple, as with the other execution
ending statements.

    \LeftLabel{End}

\end{prooftree}
