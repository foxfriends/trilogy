\subsubsection{End}
\label{sec:prose-end}

The last execution ending statement is the \kw{end} statement, of which the only
purpose is to explicitly end an execution.

The \kw{end} statement may be bare, or be provided a single value. In the case of
a bare \kw{end} statement, the execution is simply stopped, the same as any fizzle.

Meanwhile, provided a value, the program is treated to have been completed and
the value is used as the exit code, as if that value were returned from \kw{main}.
See the section on Exit Codes (\S\ref{sec:exitcode}) for more details.

        \bnfts{\kw{end}}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{Expression}
    }
\end{bnf*}

Semantically, the \kw{end} statement is very simple, as with the other execution
ending statements.
