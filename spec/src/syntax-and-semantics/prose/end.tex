\subsubsection{End}
\label{sec:prose-end}

The \kw{end} statement is another simple execution ending statement, of which the only
purpose is to explicitly end an execution. Upon executing an \kw{end} statement, the
execution immediately fizzles.

\begin{bnf*}
    \bnfprod{SEnd}{
        \bnfts{\kw{end}}
    }
\end{bnf*}

Semantically, the \kw{end} statement is very simple, as with the other execution
ending statements.
