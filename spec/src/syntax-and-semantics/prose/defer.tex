\subsubsection{Defer}
\label{sec:prose-defer}

The \kw{defer} statement defers the execution of some piece of code until the
end of the current scope in the current continuation. The resulting value of
that deferred code, if any, is lost.

The \kw{defer} statement provides the means to safely and consistently do cleanup
of resources that require explicit destruction, such as closing open files.

While this is very similar to the \kw{defer} statement of Go, in Trilogy we must
also consider the existence of multiple continuations and executions: the \kw{defer}
statement's deferred code will run only on the same continuation and execution that
initially encountered the \kw{defer} statement and caused it to run.

    \bnfprod{Defer}{
        \bnfts{\kw{defer}}
        \bnfsp
        \bnfpn{Expression}
    } \\
\end{bnf*}

Semantically, the \kw{defer} statement itself doesn't evaluate anything, only annotates
the current continuation with the code to be run later.
