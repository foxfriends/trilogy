\subsubsection{Sequences}

Sequences are statements which are to be executed in order, in typical
imperative fashion. Statements in sequence must be separated by a line break or
an explicit separator (\op{,}).

\begin{bnf*}
    \bnfprod{Sep}{\bnfpn{EOL}\bnfor\bnfts{,}} \\
    \bnfprod{Sequence}{\bnfpn{Statement}\bnfsp\bnfpn{Sep}\bnfsp\bnfpn{Sequence}\bnfor} \\
    \bnfmore{\bnfpn{Statement}\bnfor\bnfes}
\end{bnf*}

A sequence of statements has no value, but rather each step of the sequence
performs some effect on the context in which it is being run, eventually
producing the result of the program.

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash M \Rightarrow \Phi$}
    \AxiomC{$\Phi \vdash N \Rightarrow \Sigma$}
    \LeftLabel{Sequence}
    \BinaryInfC{$\Gamma \vdash M \op{,}\ N \Rightarrow \Sigma$}
\end{prooftree}

\begin{prooftree}
    \AxiomC{$\Gamma \vdash M \Rightarrow \bot$}
    \LeftLabel{Sequence\textsuperscript{$\bot$}}
    \UnaryInfC{$\Gamma \vdash M \op{,}\ N: \bot$}
\end{prooftree}
