# Trilogy Language Specification

This document explains Trilogy to the best of my abilities. At this time, it's a
pretty solid design document, but likely not rigid enough to truly be considered
a "specification"; most of the complex semantics and practical runtime semantics
are still very vague, only the theoretical semantics are documented.

Use [Tectonic][] to compile the document, or visit the latest [workflow run][] to
